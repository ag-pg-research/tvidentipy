# README  
  
This project provides tools for the identification of non-stationary processes - processes with time-varying models.   
Specifically, it implements statistical methods to build linear models from data where model parameters may change over time.   
The project includes all state-of-the-art methods such as the local basis funcion method and Kalman filtering method.  
  
## What is this repository for? 
  
* Building time-varying ARX, Volterra and other linear regression models from data  
  
## Needed dependencies
  
* Numpy
